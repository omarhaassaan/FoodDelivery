# FoodDelivery
This is a console application for delivering home-made food to customers.
There application is based on chef, customer, and delivery guy.
The user signs in as one of those 3 then if he is a chef he puts his dish giving it a name and a price so that it is placed in the menu,
then if a customer signed in he can display the menu already posted from chefs and order the dish he wants. After that, the delivery guy confirms the order.
At last, after delivering, the customer can choose either to pay with credit or cash and you can pay extra money in cash and the extra are put in the wallet
